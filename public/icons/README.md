# App Icons

This directory contains the PWA icons for thehole.app.

## Required Icons

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192px app icon
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512px app icon

## Design Guidelines

- Use the app's dark theme (#0a0a0a background)
- Include the app logo/branding
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at both sizes
- Icons should work both as-is and with maskable area (safe zone)
- Export as PNG with transparency

## Placeholder Status

**Note:** These are placeholder references. Actual icon files need to be designed and placed in this directory before production deployment.

To generate icons, you can:
1. Design in Figma/Sketch/etc at 512x512px
2. Export at both required sizes
3. Optimize with tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG
4. Place in this directory
